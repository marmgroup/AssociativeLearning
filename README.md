# overview

We built individual-based simulations in C++ to study the evolution of associative learning. The source files and the example of the parameter file are provided in the folder 'code'. 
Folder 'optimality' contains an Excel file that has been used to find the optimally performing networks and RW rule.
Folder 'supplementary material' contains Appendices A-F
